# Input Validation

Why validation?

Well, sometimes users will become confused by a question - maybe it wasn't phrased right, or maybe they just weren't thinking straight.

It is pretty vital that we ensure that when we ask for a certain type of input, that type of input has been provided.

If I ask for a number I really should validate that a number has been provided.

### Questions To Ask Yourself

- is empty input allowed?
- is it a number?
  - is it a whole number or decimal?
  - what's are the limits (minimum or maximum value)?
- is it a date?
